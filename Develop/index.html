<!-- EDITOR'S NOTES
    Hello, if you're working in this code I want to inform you of the structuring I've used for the semantic elements.
    This is by no means a be-all end-all type of thing, I just found this system to make the most sense and if you're working on this after me you're welcome to approach it as you see fit.

    For elements like the header and the footer I just used their associated semantic elements, and then a nav section for the navbar.

    For the main body content however (things like the hero and the text areas) I decided to use the "main" tag to identify the most external container and then used section for any divisions nested within that container.
    I found that this helps to keep the areas grouped under a larger title so you're not looking at a sea of divs and/or sections and trying to figure out what's what, but if you've got a different system in mind I say go for it.

                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
